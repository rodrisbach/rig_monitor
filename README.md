# RIG MONITOR

I builded my first GPU Mining Rig to mine Ethereum, and I found some troubles in the way. My rig was in my home network, and I wanted to monitor it, but I was away from home. So, I made this Telegram bot to get new asbout my rig and query health, hashrate, temperature,etc , and take action in case of some failure, restarting the miner software, o modifing some settings and parameters.

At the moment It wrote this project, I was using T-Rex miner and Flexpool,and their respective APIs. More mining software and pools will be added in the future.
